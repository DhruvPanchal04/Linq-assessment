Linq Data Take-Home Assessment

Scenario Overview

You are working in an event-driven system where messages are emitted onto an event bus. A worker service processes these events in real time, performing key calculations. However, an issue has occurred:

Some events were missed or processed incorrectly due to an error.

You need to recalculate the results while ensuring accuracy and consistency.

You cannot rely on a traditional database for storing historical event data.

Approach to Recovering and Back-Calculating Data

Understanding the Problem

Identify the missing or incorrect data:

Utilize logs, message offsets, or checkpoints to determine which events were missed.

Compare against an expected state or summary to detect anomalies.

Retrieve and reprocess events:

Replay past events from available sources like logs, caches, or event storage.

Reconstruct state using secondary sources if raw events are unavailable.

Ensure correct event sequencing to maintain data consistency.

Validate and ensure accuracy:

Implement checksum verification or expected vs. actual result comparisons.

Use idempotency techniques to prevent duplicate processing.

Technical Solution

To address this issue, we assume:

Event logs are available for replay.

Event processing is idempotent, allowing safe re-execution without duplication.

The system logs event timestamps and unique IDs, enabling accurate tracking.

Implementation Strategy

Step 1: Identify Missing Events

Compare processed event logs against expected events.

Step 2: Reprocess Missing Events

Replay missing events in the correct order.

Ensure deduplication.

Step 3: Validate Results

Use validation mechanisms like hash checks or reconciliation reports.

Trade-offs and Limitations

Trade-offs

Log-based Recovery:

✅ Works if logs are available.

❌ May be incomplete if logs are lost or corrupted.

Event Replay Mechanism:

✅ Ensures correctness through reprocessing.

❌ Requires support from the event bus.

State Reconstruction:

✅ Works even if logs are missing.

❌ Can be computationally expensive.

Limitations

Incomplete logs may make full recovery impossible.

Reprocessing overhead could be high for large event volumes.

Side effects of replaying events must be carefully managed.

Scaling for High-Volume Systems

For systems processing millions of events per hour, enhancements include:

Parallel Processing: Use distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink, Spark) to handle event reprocessing efficiently.

Batch Processing: Instead of processing events one by one, process them in chunks.

Message Deduplication: Implement an idempotency mechanism to prevent double processing.

Optimized Event Storage: Store events in a scalable system like Apache Pulsar, S3, or cloud object storage.

Enhancements with Additional Tools

With a Database: Store event states for direct querying and comparison.

With Enhanced Logging: Structured logs improve recoverability.

With a Streaming System (e.g., Apache Kafka, Flink): Real-time monitoring and automated anomaly detection.
